    I graduated from Portland State University in 2014 with a B.S. in 
    Biological Science. I started learning to program in January of 2016 
    because I was unhappy with the field of Biology. A friend working as a 
    Senior Developer gave me some resources to use, and I began to complete 
    coding challenges on sites like HackerRank to gain experience using Python, 
    C++, C#, and Java.
